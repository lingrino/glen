Glen is a simple command line tool that, when run within a local GitLab project, will call the GitLab API to get all environment variables from your project's CI/CD pipeline and print them locally, ready for exporting.

With the default flags you can run `eval $(glen -r)` to export your project's variables and the variables of every parent group.

## Installation

The easiest way to install glen is with [homebrew][]

```console
brew install lingrino/tap/glen
```

Glen can also be installed by downloading the latest binary from the releases page and adding it to your path.

Alternatively you can install glen using `go get`, assuming you have `$GOPATH/bin` in your path.

```console
go get -u github.com/lingrino/glen
```

## Usage

By default glen assumes that you have a GitLab API key exported as `GITLAB_TOKEN` and that you are calling glen from within a git repo where the GitLab remote is named `origin` (see `git remote -v`).

You can override all of these settings, specifying the API key, git directory, or GitLab remote name as flags on the command line (see `glen --help`).

By default glen will only get the variables from the current GitLab project. If you would also like glen to merge in variables from all of the project's parent groups then you can use `glen -r`

Lastly, the default output for glen is called `export`, meaning that the ouput is ready to be read into your shell and will export all variables. This lets you call glen as `eval $(glen)` as a one line command to export all variables locally. You can also specify a `json` or `table` output for more machine or human friendly outputs.

```console
$ glen --help
